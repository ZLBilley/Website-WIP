	Idea! Find profit!

	Earnings per hour.

	Tip - cash trip entries list no tip! Have to remove this from estimate
	Distance - mileage is wear and tear on the car, a cost per mile is subtracted
	Time - addded in a set number in order to make a rough approximation of loading time/driving to a new fare time


	Cleaning steps - reverse flipped latitude longitude


	First graph set - kernel density estimator to make a "density" map of profit by pickup location

	Idea, find the high profit density areas, contour out the big ones, and see if we do better than city average sticking to those areas.

	Results: From the contour region, we get an average of ___ vs city average of ___

	Why: Trips from less dense areas probably have a higher earnings per hour metric. This is probably accounted for by the fact that areas cabs tend ot have to drive out to have higher rates built into the fare.

	Let's throw a clustering algorithm at it to get arbitrary region divisions, so we can look at each of those by the hour of the day

	Analysis - most of the improvement that can be made over the baseline appears to be pickign up rides from the airport at jsut about the right time. Around noon and in the evening. There's also a slight advantage to knowing where to be in the early early morning.
