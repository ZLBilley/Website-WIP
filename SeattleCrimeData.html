The City of Seattle is broken up into five precincts: North, West, East, Southwest, and Southeast.
Each of those precincts have a number of sectors, denoted by a letter. For example, 'M' is downtown Seattle. Each of those sectors has a number of beats denoted by a letter-number pair. M1 is then one of the beats in the M sector.

For this analysis, I decided to look at the sector level. There's enough of them that there's variation over the city, but not so many that the number would get overwhelming.
